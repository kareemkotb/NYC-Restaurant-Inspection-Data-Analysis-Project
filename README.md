# NYC-Restaurant-Inspection-Data-Analysis-Project

## üèôÔ∏è Project Background  

At the **New York City Department of Health (DOH)**.  
The department inspects restaurants citywide to ensure food safety and compliance with public health regulations.  
Each inspection results in a **numerical score** and a **grade (A‚ÄìC)**, which affect restaurant reputations and consumer trust.  

This project analyzes NYC restaurant inspection data to uncover:  
- Which cuisines and boroughs have the most violations  
- The distribution of inspection grades  
- The most common violation types  
- Differences between **critical** and **non-critical** issues  

**Insights and recommendations** are provided on the following key areas:  
- Borough & Cuisine Trends  
- Violation Patterns  
- Inspection Performance  
- Data Quality & Operational Efficiency

2. **Address Critical Violations:** Prioritize training and re-inspection around temperature control and pest management.  
3. **Seasonal Oversight:** Increase inspection frequency in warmer months to reduce pest and contamination issues.  
4. **Enhance Transparency:** Encourage timely publication of inspection results to boost public confidence.  
5. **Data Quality Improvements:** Standardize cuisine and inspection type categories for consistent analytics.
